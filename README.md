# Popular Movies Project, a project for my Udacity Android Developer NanoDegree course

## Project Overview
The app retrieve and present in consistent way data using [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) API

Please **note** that the project does not contain any private API-Key, so first it is necessary to store your API-Key.
API-Key can be added in gradle.properties file or could be a new OS environment variable.

In gradle.properties file you can add the property:
TMDB_API_KEY="your-pi-key-value-abcd1234567890"

Environment variable is made up of a key and a value of this form:
TMDB_API_KEY="your-pi-key-value-abcd1234567890"

I would also like to point out that in this project I have used an image from: http://www.freegreatdesign.com/vector/film-element-vector-material-4-5749
used like error placeholder
and others free images from:
